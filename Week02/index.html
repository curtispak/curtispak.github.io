		<h1> <i> Response to Week02 Readings </i> </h1>
		<h2> <b> by Curtis Pak <b> </h2>

    <p> The articles "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush (1945) and Long Live The Web by Tim Berners Lee (2010) connect to many of the topics and themes related to dystopian futures. In the article by Vannevar Bush, he
      discusses many of the ethical issues that come with the rise in power of technology. Similar to many scholars of his time, he was frightened by the unknown potential of technology and the ability of humanity to abuse it. He fear was very much
      warranted considering the various issues that are prevalent today due to technology and science. In this reading, he coins a term known as the <i> "memex" </i> which he defines as <i> "A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
      records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". </i> It is truly frightening because his definition of a memex is around today, otherwise known as the <i> internet </i>. The internet
      is a tool where everything and everyone is connected, a encylopedia with infinite information where its potential is unbound. This article was written and released almost 25 years before the internet was actually created, and the accuracy of Vaneevar's prediction
      only adds to the frightening situation that we live in today. </p>

    <p> Throughout history, there are many tools that were invented for specific purposes that have been manipulated by people in order to serve their purposes. There were some that have been altered for the purpose of rightoutness and there were also many
      have been exploited for the intent of evil and greed. In <i> Long Live the Web </i> by Tim Berners Lee, he discusses how the original purpose of the internet and the web have changed throughout the years. He states that the original purpose of the web was
      to be an open area where people will be able to share knowledge and information with people around the globe, an innovation that many people thought would propel the world forward together. Although the original purpose has not been lost and the web still
      proves to be a beneficial tool to this day, there are many who abuse and manipulated the web in order to serve their own agenda and greed. There are bodies of power such as the government and corporations that use the internet to spy on people and invade
      their privacy by stealing their information. It is scary how these two articles, 65 years apart from each other, relate to each other in discussing a pressing issue that is incredibly relvant in today's time. Tim Berners Lee states that it is up to us,
      to preserve the web's original purpose and to enforce moral standards to prevent malicious people from exploiting the internet and the people who use it.

		<h1>Ways of Seeing Things Response</h1>
		<p>by Curtis Pak</p>

    <p> In John Berger's "Ways of Seeing Things", he offers many thought-provoking points about the way that art had been perceived in the past in contrast with the current perception
      of art with modern technology. In the beginning of the video, he offers a very thought-provoking point about how with the power of photography, the way people perceive art will be changed
      forever. Although this video was made many decades ago, I find this point to be oddly relatable to our lives today. It reminded me of the issue of social media that is present in our lives today,
      about how everyone wants to take a picture and/or record a moment rather than living in it. People are so obsessed with retaining that specific memory and focus more on capturing it rather
      than appreciating it. This relates to John Berger's point on the environment of where the viewer perceives the art changes many different aspects of the art piece itself.
      I agree with John Berger's interpretation that reproduction of an art does not necessarily have to connect with a negative connotation,but rather a positive one.
      With the mass reproduction of art, I agree that it does make it easier to connect our experiences with that certain piece and gives us a whole new fresh persective.
      This may be a generalization but I do believe that there is a great sense of pretentiousness when it comes to art, and this comes along with a disconnect for many people. But with the power
      of modern technology and reproduction, it allows individuals to perceive art in their perspective with a new environment that has not yet been seen before

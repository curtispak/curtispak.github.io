      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px">For the midterm project, I did something that forced me to expand and test my knowledge of web design. So for this project,
        I wanted to create something that represents a part of myself. Something that I have a much more emotional connection with.

      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px">To give an explanation as what this is, the best way to describe this piece is a "Virtual Stressball". There is a plethora of reasons as to why
        I decided to make this. One reason that really influenced this project was the whole situation of this pandemic. Being stuck at home, unable to see many of my family and friends due to social distancing
        , I felt that I lost an emotional connection.I needed another way to vent my emotions and feelings. So I created this project which is a sound-reactive data visualizer.

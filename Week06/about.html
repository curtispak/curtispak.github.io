      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">My name is Curtis Pak and I am mechanical keyboards enthusaist currently residing in NYC.</h2>
      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px">I was first introduced into the hobby when I bought my first "gaming" mechanical keyboard.
        For some odd reason, I fell in love with the way it sounded and felt. Due to that, I set out on a journey to find the "best" keyboard there is.
        After obtaining and building various keyboards, I want to help others obtain their own custom mechanical keyboard.

		<div id = "p2"><p> An important part of the Spectacle is the use of images. Throughout the entire chapter Debord discusses
		the impact that the overuse of images have on our society. He states that the overuse of images will weaken the mind and destroy our ability to have a social life
		It is very scary and interesting how this statement is relevant to us today with the
		various issues regarding social media and our mental frame that is shaped due to it. "The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images" </p>

    <li> Irises (1889) </li>
    <p>Irises is one of Vincent Van Gogh's most famous paintings. He painted it in the year before his death and referred to it as the "the lightning conductor for my illness" as he felt his work was his hope against becoming insane. He drew
      the painting at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence, France.

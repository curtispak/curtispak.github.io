    <li> Starry Night (1889)</li>
    <p>Another one of Vincent Van Gogh's most well known paintings was "The Starry Night". Compared to "Irises", there was a tonal shift in his work.
      He returned to incorporating the darker colors from the beginning of his career and Starry Night is a wonderful example of that shift. Blue dominates the painting, blending hills into the sky.
      The little village lays at the base in the painting in browns, greys, and blues. Even though each building is clearly outlined in black, the yellow and white of the stars and the moon stand out against the sky, drawing the eyes to the sky.
      They are the big attention grabber of the painting.
